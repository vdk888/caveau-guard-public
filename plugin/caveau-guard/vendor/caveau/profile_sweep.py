"""
profile_sweep.py — self-improving second pass (Joris's idea, 2026-06-01).

THE IDEA
--------
Pass 1 (regex + GLiNER + structured) DISCOVERS the client's identifiers with high
confidence — full name, IBAN, e-mail, phone, passport, family-member names. But a
context-blind first pass MISSES *detached* references to those same people: a lone
a lone first name far from the full name, a surname in a relations table
, a name split across a form layout.

Pass 2 is a SELF-IMPROVING SWEEP: take the high-confidence entities found in pass 1,
build a "known client profile", then sweep the WHOLE document (and, across a
dossier, every other document of the same client) for any occurrence of those known
values OR their components (each token of a known full name). Recall-first: a missed
PII is the real risk, and a name we already KNOW belongs to the client is safe to
redact everywhere it appears.

Two compounding wins:
  1. Within a doc: catches detached / partial references the first pass missed.
  2. Across a dossier (8 docs of one client): discover the profile once, reuse it on
     all docs → near-total consistency AND a coherent vault (same token for the same
     person in every document).

Safety: we only ADD occurrences of values ALREADY validated as client PII in pass 1.
We never invent new identities. Name COMPONENTS are swept only if they're
"distinctive" (length ≥ 4, not a common word) to avoid redacting "de"/"la"/"louis"
as bare stopwords — though for surnames we accept the risk (recall-first).
