allowlist.py — "this is NOT the client" filter (the big precision lever).

THE INSIGHT (validated on real client DERs)
-------------------------------------------
A CGP subscription dossier is ~90% the ADVISORY FIRM's own boilerplate, not the
client. A real client DER produced ~35 raw detections of which nearly ALL were
false positives: the firm's own name/address, its advisors' names, its e-mail
domain, plus regulators (AMF, ACPR, CNIL), a mediator, the insurer and dozens of
fund houses (Corum, Nortia, Primonial…). Anonymising any of those is WRONG — it
isn't the secret, and it destroys the document's meaning.

So the hard problem isn't "find names", it's "distinguish CLIENT data from
FIRM / REGULATOR / COUNTERPARTY boilerplate". This module is the deterministic,
cheap, high-precision half of that: a configurable allowlist of entities that are
known NOT to be the client, applied as a post-detection filter. Whatever the
detectors flag that matches the allowlist is dropped (kept in clear).

It is intentionally DATA, not code: the firm's own identity + the public third
parties are configured PER DEPLOYMENT in a local, gitignored config file
(`deployment_allowlist.json` — see `deployment_allowlist.example.json` for the
schema). The firm's own identity is client business data, so it never lives in
source / version control. The LLM/context layer then handles the residual
ambiguity ("is this remaining name the client or a relative?"). Allowlist =
precision floor; context layer = the judgment.

Conservative by default: matching is case-insensitive substring/lemma on the
detected span. We only ever REMOVE a detection (fail toward anonymising): if a
client genuinely shared a surname with an advisor, the allowlist could suppress a
real client hit — so the allowlist holds FULL identifiers (full names, full
addresses, the e-mail domain), never bare first names, to keep that risk near zero.
