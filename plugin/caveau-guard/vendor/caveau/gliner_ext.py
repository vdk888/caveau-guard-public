"""
gliner_ext.py — OPTIONAL local NER layer using GLiNER (the prose/context layer).

Why GLiNER over a 7B LLM for this job (validated 2026-06-01 on real CGP
KYC docs): GLiNER is a 0.3B span-extraction model (multilingual, incl. FR) that
runs on CPU/MPS with no GPU, in parallel, with no prompt fragility. On the real
a real DCC it matched a 7B-class model's usefulness at a fraction of the cost and
latency. It is the right "soft PII" layer (person names, addresses, prose-only
identifiers) on top of the checksum-backed regex layer in `recognizers.py`.

THE CHUNKING IS LOAD-BEARING, NOT AN OPTIMISATION
-------------------------------------------------
GLiNER has a hard ~384-token window. A single `predict_entities` call on a full
dossier (10k+ chars) SILENTLY TRUNCATES to the first ~1500 chars and drops the
rest (observed: "Sentence of length 2274 has been truncated to 384"). On the real
DCC that meant 5 entities instead of 13 — the client's mobile, personal e-mail and
the partner's data all lived past the cutoff. So we ALWAYS run a sliding window
with overlap and UNION the spans (recall-first: a missed PII is the real risk).
Overlap guarantees an entity straddling a chunk boundary is seen whole in at least
one window. (Joris's multi-pass idea, confirmed by measurement.)

Design choices (mirrors llm_ext.py):
  - **Off by default & fail-open**: if gliner/torch aren't installed or the model
    can't load, `gliner_matches` returns [] and the engine behaves exactly like the
    pure-regex build. The layer only ever ADDS recall.
  - **Lazy, cached model load**: import + load happen on first use, then the model
    is memoised for the process (loading is the slow part, ~2-5s; inference is fast).
  - **Scores carried through**: GLiNER confidences flow into the fail-closed
    threshold — a name found only by GLiNER below threshold is "review", not "safe".
  - **Label → caveau entity-type mapping**: GLiNER returns the natural-language
    label we asked for; we map it to caveau's canonical types (NOM, ADRESSE, …).

Enable it:
    AnonymizationEngine(extra_detectors=[gliner_matches])
or pass a configured detector via `make_gliner_detector(...)`.
