"""
structured_ext.py — deterministic recognizers for FR-KYC FORM layouts.

Why this exists (validated 2026-06-01): in real CGP KYC PDFs the data is a
detached form — labels in one block, values in another. Two identifying fields
survive there as strong POSITIONAL patterns that the context-sensitive GLiNER
layer loses in a big chunk, but that a tiny regex nails with high precision:

  1. BIRTHPLACE printed right after a date of birth on the same value line:
       "04/05/1980 LYON (France)"  /  "12/09/1975 BORDEAUX"
     i.e. `DD/MM/YYYY  <City>[ (Country)]`. The city (and any parenthetical
     country) is the identifying birthplace. GLiNER caught these in isolation
     (caught in isolation 0.6-0.9) but dropped mid-document — this recovers them.

  2. MARRIAGE / PACS dates that sit far from their "Date de mariage/PACS" label,
     but appear as a bare `DD/MM/YYYY [LIEU]` on a value line that ISN'T a DOB
     (DOBs are already covered by the core DATE_NAISSANCE recognizer).

These are opt-in `extra_detectors` (same fail-open contract as gliner_ext), so the
core RECOGNIZERS list and the existing test suite are untouched. Recall-first:
they only ADD matches; overlap resolution in the engine lets a more-specific
match win.

# ── Civility + name recognizer (clean NAME source for form layouts) ─────────
#
# Why this exists (2026-06-01 refactor): name-token learning was sourced from the
# greedy core NOM regex, which over-extends across line breaks in the detached
# KYC form layout — a title+name glued to a product line → it learnt "EUROPE"/"LIFINITY"
# as part of the client's name and swept those across the dossier. GLiNER is
# semantically clean but UNDER-detects names in some form layouts. So we add
# a deterministic, PRECISE name source: a civility title followed by 1-3
# capitalised name words ON THE SAME LINE. The single-line constraint ([^\S\n] =
# whitespace but NOT newline) is the whole point — the name is just what sits
# beside the title; the product on the next line is never pulled in.
_TITLE = r"(?:M\.|Mr|Mme|Mlle|Monsieur|Madame|Mademoiselle|Me|Dr)"

# Same-line: "M. Jean DUPONT".

# Detached form layout: a LONE title on its own line, the name on the NEXT line
# (lone title line, name on the next line). The first pass with the
# single-line NOM regex loses these (the title line has no name); this recovers
# them. Only fires when the title is alone on its line (so we don't double-count
# the same-line case).
