"""
context_boost.py — context-word confidence boosting (Presidio-inspired).

A detection that sits NEAR a PII cue word is much more likely to be real. A name
right after "Client :" / "demeurant" / "né le" is almost certainly a person; the
same capitalised words floating next to a form heading ("Senior manager") are
not. So we boost a match's score when a cue word appears within a small window
around it.

Why this matters for Caveau (2026-06-01): the fail-closed verdict flagged lots of
low-confidence GLiNER guesses on form LABELS ("Senior manager", "conseiller") as
"à vérifier", cluttering the result. Boosting lifts the GENUINE low-confidence
detections (a real name near "Client:") over the 0.6 threshold so they're treated
as certain, while leaving the isolated label-guesses low. Net: fewer false
"à vérifier" items, same recall, no new risk (we only ever RAISE scores of things
we already detected — never invent or redact more).

Pure-stdlib, no dependency. Applied as a post-detection step in the engine,
BEFORE the allowlist filter and the residual scan.
