"""
dossier.py — anonymise a WHOLE dossier (many files of one client) coherently.

A CGP subscription dossier is 8+ documents about the SAME client. Processing them
one-by-one with a fresh vault each time gives INCONSISTENT results: the same
client can get a different token (or, in surrogate mode, a different fake) in each
file, and a client who's only mentioned in passing in one document (e.g. buried in
the entrée-en-relation boilerplate) is missed there.

Dossier mode fixes both by sharing state across all files:
  - ONE vault → the same client always gets the same token / surrogate everywhere
    (coherent across the whole dossier; the correspondence table is unified).
  - ONE self-improving profile → the client discovered in the rich KYC is then
    swept into every other document, including the ones where a single pass would
    miss him. This is the cross-file ACCURACY win.

Pure logic, no web dependency — the webapp and tests both call `anonymize_dossier`.
