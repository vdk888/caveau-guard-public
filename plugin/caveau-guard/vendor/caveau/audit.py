audit.py — append-only processing record (RGPD art. 5-2 / 30, accountability).

This is the "registre des activités de traitement" in miniature: a local,
append-only log that proves WHAT was processed — which mission, what kind of
entities, how many of each, and the fail-closed verdict — WITHOUT ever storing
the PII values themselves.

    CRITICAL INVARIANT: counts & types IN, raw values OUT.

An audit log that leaked the names/emails/IBANs it audits would defeat the whole
privacy purpose. So an entry looks like

    {"timestamp": "2026-06-01T12:00:00Z", "mission": "dossier-x",
     "event": "anonymize", "counts": {"NOM": 4, "EMAIL": 2, "IBAN": 1},
     "total": 7, "safe_to_send": false}

— never a real name, e-mail or IBAN. The log is still a processing record, so we
keep the file private (0600) even though it holds no values.

The file is JSONL: one JSON object per line, opened in append ("a") mode only —
never rewritten — so the record is tamper-evident-by-convention and survives
concurrent appends without clobbering earlier entries.

Pure logic, no web dependency — the webapp, the dossier flow and the tests all
call into here.
