# Changelog — caveau-guard

All notable changes to the plugin. Bump the version in BOTH
`plugin/caveau-guard/.claude-plugin/plugin.json` and the repo-root
`.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` (two places) on every release, or clients'
`claude plugin update` will report "already at latest" and skip the new code.

## 1.2.1 — 2026-06-02

- **Encrypted vaults now work with zero install too.** Re-implemented vault
  encryption in pure Python stdlib (PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256 key derivation + an
  HMAC-SHA256 counter-mode cipher + encrypt-then-MAC authentication), dropping
  the `cryptography` dependency. So saving/loading a passphrase-protected vault
  runs on any Mac's built-in python3 — no `pip install`, fully offline. Wrong
  passphrase or a tampered file fails loudly (constant-time MAC check). Legacy
  v1 (scrypt+Fernet) vault files still load when `cryptography` is present.

## 1.2.0 — 2026-06-02

- **Fully self-contained — works as a complete product with zero install.** The
  plugin now bundles its dependencies under `vendor/` (the Caveau engine + a
  pure-python `pypdf`), so the anonymiser runs from a GitHub install or a Cowork
  zip with **no `pip install`, no engine on the user's machine, no network**.
  Same approach as Bubble Sentinel.
- `.docx` is now read with the Python standard library (zipfile + ElementTree) —
  no `python-docx`/`lxml` needed. PDF via the vendored pypdf. Plain text native.
- Scripts + the `caveau-anonymize` skill load the bundled engine via
  `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/vendor`. The firm-identity config is never vendored.

## 1.1.0 — 2026-06-02

- **In-folder marker protection (Cowork-native).** Drop a `.caveau-guard.json`
  inside a folder to protect it + its subtree; the guard walks up from each
  accessed file to the nearest marker. Works inside Cowork's sandbox (which can't
  write to `~/.config`). Opt-in: only marked folders are guarded.
- **Chat-box tripwire** (`UserPromptSubmit` hook): nudges/blocks when raw PII is
  pasted or a document is uploaded directly in the conversation.
- **Client identity removed from source.** The firm allowlist now loads from a
  gitignored deployment config; source ships only generic public third parties.
- Onboarding skill + docs rewritten to the Cowork flow (request the client
  folder, write the marker into it — no Terminal, no `~/.config`).

## 1.0.0 — 2026-06-01

- Initial release: fail-closed `PreToolUse` guard blocking reads of
  `protected_folders` (global config) + bundled `caveau-anonymize` and
  `caveau-onboarding` skills.
