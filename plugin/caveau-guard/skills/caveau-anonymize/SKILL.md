description: Anonymise a protected client folder through Caveau before reading it. Use when the caveau-guard hook blocks access to a client dossier, or when the user asks to "anonymise", "cloak", "pseudonymise", or "run Caveau on" a folder or file containing client PII. Handles PDF and Word (.docx) files automatically (text extracted before anonymising), plus .txt/.md/.csv/.json. Produces a local, reversible, fail-closed anonymised copy whose token↔value vault never leaves the machine.

# Caveau — anonymise before reading

The `caveau-guard` hook blocks reads of protected client folders because raw
identifying data must never enter the model context in clear. This skill is the
sanctioned path: anonymise locally first, then work on the cloaked copy.

## When you were just blocked

If a tool call was denied with a `🔒 Caveau` message, do NOT try to bypass it
(no `cat`, no copying the file elsewhere, no reading via Bash). Instead:

1. Tell the user the file is in a protected folder and offer to anonymise it.
2. Run the anonymisation below into a `clean/` sub-folder.
3. Read and work on the anonymised copy.
4. When you produce an answer that contains tokens like `⟦NOM_0001⟧`,
   de-anonymise it locally for the user with the same vault.

## How to anonymise (local, offline)

The plugin is **fully self-contained** — it bundles the Caveau engine and a
pure-python PDF reader under `vendor/`, so it runs from a GitHub install or a
Cowork zip with **no `pip install`, no engine on the user's machine, no
network**. Just Python 3.10+ (already present on any Mac).

**PDFs and plain files work out of the box.** `scripts/caveau_extract.py` turns a
`.pdf` (and `.txt/.md/.csv/.json`) into text *before* anonymising — one command
covers a whole dossier. `.docx` is the one format that still needs an extra lib
(`pip install python-docx`); a scanned/image-only or encrypted PDF **fails
closed** (raises, never returns empty) — extract its text by hand, never wave it
through.

```bash
# Whole dossier → cloaked copies + one shared vault. PDFs auto-extracted.
python3 - <<'PY'
import os, sys
from pathlib import Path

# Self-contained: the plugin bundles its deps under vendor/ (the engine + pypdf).
# CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT is exported by Claude Code while the plugin is active.
PLUGIN_ROOT = Path(os.environ.get("CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT", Path(__file__).resolve().parent))
sys.path.insert(0, str(PLUGIN_ROOT / "vendor"))    # bundled caveau engine + pypdf
sys.path.insert(0, str(PLUGIN_ROOT / "scripts"))   # bundled extractor
from caveau_extract import extract_file, ExtractionError

from caveau import AnonymizationEngine, Vault

SRC = Path("~/Dossiers-clients/dossier-dupont").expanduser()   # the protected folder
OUT = SRC / "clean"                                            # allow-listed output dir
OUT.mkdir(exist_ok=True)

vault = Vault(mission=SRC.name)          # ONE shared vault per dossier → same client = same token everywhere
engine = AnonymizationEngine(vault=vault)

PATTERNS = ("*.txt", "*.md", "*.csv", "*.json", "*.pdf", "*.docx")
for pat in PATTERNS:
    for f in sorted(SRC.glob(pat)):
        try:
            text = extract_file(f)               # PDF/.docx → text; plain files decode
        except ExtractionError as e:
            print(f"⛔ {f.name}: {e} — SKIP (extrais le texte à la main, ne le laisse pas passer)")
            continue
        res = engine.anonymize(text)
        (OUT / f"{f.stem}.anon.txt").write_text(res.anonymized, encoding="utf-8")
        if not res.safe_to_send:
            print(f"⚠️ {f.name}: {res.verdict_fr} — relecture humaine requise")

vault.save_encrypted(str(SRC / ".vault.enc"), passphrase="<set-by-operator>")  # coffre chiffré, reste local
print("done — clean/ contains the cloaked copies; the vault never leaves this machine")
PY
```

If `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` isn't set in your shell (e.g. running the snippet by
hand), point `sys.path` at the plugin's `scripts/` dir directly, or call the
extractor as a CLI: `python3 <plugin>/scripts/caveau_extract.py <file.pdf>`.

Then read `clean/*.anon.txt` (the `clean/` sub-folder should be in the guard's
`allow_paths`, or `.anon.txt` in `allow_extensions`, so it's readable).

## De-anonymise the answer

When you've drafted a summary/letter that still contains `⟦TYPE_NNNN⟧` tokens,
restore the real values locally before handing it to the user:

```python
from caveau import AnonymizationEngine, Vault
vault = Vault.load_encrypted("~/Dossiers-clients/dossier-dupont/.vault.enc", passphrase="...")
engine = AnonymizationEngine(vault=vault)
print(engine.deanonymize(draft_with_tokens))
```

## Show the before/after visually (the "visual tool", Cowork-native)

When the user wants to *see* what gets masked vs kept — the before/after, the
verdict, and the masquer/conserver table — generate a Caveau **artifact** and
present it. This is the Cowork equivalent of the local webapp (which can't run in
Cowork's sandbox: its server binds to the VM's localhost, not the user's screen).

```bash
# Generates one self-contained HTML file (same view + styling as the webapp).
python3 ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/make_artifact.py \
  --file "<a dossier file>" --mission "<dossier name>" \
  --out "<a writable path, e.g. the session outputs dir>/caveau-apercu.html"
# or feed text directly:  --text "…"
```

Then present that HTML file to the user as an artifact (Cowork: `present_files` /
`create_artifact` with the generated file). It renders on their screen with the
before/after columns, the verdict, and the masquer/conserver toggle table.

**The masquer/conserver toggles** reflect the current policy. The artifact is
sandboxed HTML so it can't write to disk itself — when the user wants to change a
setting ("conserve les montants", "masque le poste"), YOU update the policy
(`caveau.policy.save_policy`) and re-run, then re-present the artifact. Same
outcome as clicking save in the webapp.

**For a non-technical user demo, never use real client data** — use a fictional
sample (the engine has none baked in; make up a plausible "Jean Dupont" record).

## Rules

- **Never bypass the guard.** No reading the raw file via an alternate tool.
- **One vault per dossier** so the same client gets the same token across all files.
- **Fail-closed:** if `safe_to_send` is false, flag it — do not treat the doc as safe.
- **The vault is the secret.** It stays on the machine; it is never sent to any model.
