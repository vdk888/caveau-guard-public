"""Caveau — SessionStart self-installer for Cowork.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
In Claude Cowork (Desktop), the agent runs in a VM spawned with
`--setting-sources=user`. That flag means Cowork loads hooks ONLY from the VM's
user settings (`$HOME/.claude/settings.json`, i.e. `/root/.claude/settings.json`)
and SILENTLY ignores hooks bundled in a plugin's `hooks/hooks.json`
(see anthropics/claude-code issue #16288). So our PreToolUse guard + the
UserPromptSubmit tripwire never fire in Cowork when they live only in the plugin.

The fix the community converged on: a SessionStart hook (which DOES fire from a
plugin in Cowork) writes the guard hooks into the user settings file at session
start. This script is that installer. It is idempotent — it only writes if the
guard hooks aren't already present, and never disturbs other hooks.

On the CLI (outside Cowork) the plugin's own hooks.json already works, so this is
a harmless no-op there (it just ensures the same hooks exist in user settings).

Run as a SessionStart command hook. Reads the event JSON on stdin (unused). Exits
0 always — a failed self-install must never block the session.

# the next session runs a PreToolUse command whose script no longer exists → the
# hook errors → and a failing PreToolUse hook BLOCKS the tool. Result: every
# Bash/Read dies and the user's Claude is bricked until someone hand-edits
# settings.json. (This actually happened.)
#
# Fix: copy the hook scripts ONCE into a stable, never-purged location under the
# user's real home, and point the settings hook at THAT copy — never at the temp
# plugin root. We also wrap the command so a missing script FAILS OPEN (a guard
# that can't find itself must not brick the machine).
