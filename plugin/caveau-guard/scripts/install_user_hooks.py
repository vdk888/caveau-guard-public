"""Caveau — SessionStart self-installer for Cowork.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
In Claude Cowork (Desktop), the agent runs in a VM spawned with
`--setting-sources=user`. That flag means Cowork loads hooks ONLY from the VM's
user settings (`$HOME/.claude/settings.json`, i.e. `/root/.claude/settings.json`)
and SILENTLY ignores hooks bundled in a plugin's `hooks/hooks.json`
(see anthropics/claude-code issue #16288). So our PreToolUse guard + the
UserPromptSubmit tripwire never fire in Cowork when they live only in the plugin.

The fix the community converged on: a SessionStart hook (which DOES fire from a
plugin in Cowork) writes the guard hooks into the user settings file at session
start. This script is that installer. It is idempotent — it only writes if the
guard hooks aren't already present, and never disturbs other hooks.

On the CLI (outside Cowork) the plugin's own hooks.json already works, so this is
a harmless no-op there (it just ensures the same hooks exist in user settings).

Run as a SessionStart command hook. Reads the event JSON on stdin (unused). Exits
0 always — a failed self-install must never block the session.

    WHY THIS GATE EXISTS (incident: repeated host-Mac self-lock)
    -----------------------------------------------------------
    This installer writes a PreToolUse guard + UserPromptSubmit tripwire into
    `$HOME/.claude/settings.json`. That file is SHARED by every Claude on the
    host Mac — CLI sessions, crons, the Desktop app. When this installer ran on
    the real Mac it spilled the guard into the host's user settings, where it
    could (and did) block every Bash/Read for unrelated sessions and scheduled
    tasks. The guard must arm in Cowork and NOWHERE ELSE.

    We confirmed (live Cowork probe, 2026-06-14 + anthropics/claude-code#40495)
    the reliable Cowork-VM signals:
      - HOME is `/sessions/<name>`  (host Mac HOME is `/Users/...` or `/root`
        only in older layouts — never `/sessions/`). This is the primary gate:
        a real Mac can never have HOME under /sessions/.
      - CLAUDE_CODE_IS_COWORK == "1"        (set in the host-loop/hook context)
      - CLAUDE_CODE_ENTRYPOINT == "local-agent"

    We treat ANY of these as "in Cowork". On the host Mac none of them hold, so
    the installer no-ops → the host settings.json is NEVER touched. Fail-safe
    direction: if we cannot positively confirm Cowork, we DO NOT install
    (better an unarmed guard than a bricked Mac — the plugin's own hooks.json
    still provides protection where the platform honours it).
